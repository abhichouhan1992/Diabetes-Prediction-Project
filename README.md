# Data-Science-Project-3
Prediction who has Diabetes Mellitus over Diabetes dataset using Support Vector Machine.
# Introduction
The Diabetes dataset contains 768 samples which determines if patient has diabetes or not. Each sample contains eight features Pregnancies,Glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThickness,Insulin,BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age.
# Problem Domain
We have csv file of Diabetes dataset and has eight features in it. The dataset is in Numerical form. these eight features will determine the outcome of diabetes mellitus so we use Supervised machine learning for better prediction our model.
# Solution Domain
For this Diabetes dataset we will use Support vector Machine Algorithm because (SVM) algorithm is a versatile and widely used machine learning algorithm that is primarily used for its simplicity and ease of implementation. In SVM we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional plane,where n is no.of features dataset has with value of each feature being a value of particular coordinate then the dataset is classify by finding hyperplane that differentiate the two classes very well.
# Technology Used
We used Jupyter Notebook(version 7) for Diabetes dataset algorithm and also diffent types of library from python such as numpy, pandas , matplotlib, seaborn 
and Scikit-Learn.
# Mathematical Formula
SVM algorithm works on principle of hyperplane.
Hyperplane is plane which forms by best segregation of dataset.
Each datapoint is called as support vector.
All hyperplanes are required to be parameterized by vector W and constant b can be expressed as Wx + b= 0
The distance between support vectors is called margin, denoted by "r".
Where r=|Wx + b|/W, (Wx + b is vector quantity and W is Scalar quantity).
# Conclusion
For this project, I mainly worked through the Python documentation manuals of the Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn modules as well as the Python 3 documentation. There are many resources freely available for learning how to use Python and applying it to analysing datasets such as the Diabetes dataset. The pandas library is quite intuitive and in a valuable tool in investigating and analysing multi-class multi-variates datasets such as the Diabetes dataset.I looked at the statistical properties of the Diabetes data set in this project.Visualising the data gives a better understanding of the data and what can be done with it. The Diabetes data set is referenced quite a bit in machine learning and many resources on the internet use it to demonstrate their product or to teach machine learning methods.We used Scikit-Learn library to implement better prediction of model.
